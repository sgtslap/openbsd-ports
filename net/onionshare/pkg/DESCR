Tool for sharing files of any size anonymously over the Tor public
anonymity network.

It works by starting a web server, making it accessible as a Tor onion
service, and generating an unguessable URL to access and download the
files. It doesn't require setting up a server on the internet somewhere
or using a third party file-sharing service. The file on your own
computer and use a Tor onion service to make it temporarily accessible
over the internet. The other user just needs to use Tor Browser to
download the file from you.
