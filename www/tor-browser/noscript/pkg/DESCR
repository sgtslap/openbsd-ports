The NoScript Firefox extension provides extra protection for Firefox,
Seamonkey and other mozilla-based browsers: this free, open source
add-on allows JavaScript, Java, Flash and other plugins to be executed
only by trusted web sites of your choice (e.g. your online bank).

This package provides the NoScript add-on for use with Tor Browser.
It will not work with any other Mozilla-based browser package.
