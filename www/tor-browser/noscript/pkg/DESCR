The NoScript Firefox extension provides extra protection for Firefox,
Seamonkey and other mozilla-based browsers: this free, open source
add-on allows JavaScript, Java, Flash and other plugins to be executed
only by trusted web sites of your choice (e.g. your online bank).

NoScript also provides the most powerful anti-XSS and
anti-Clickjacking protection ever available in a browser.
