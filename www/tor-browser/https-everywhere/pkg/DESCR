HTTPS Everywhere is a Firefox extension from the EFF that forces HTTPS
use wherever possible when browsing.  It does this by means of an
extensive set of rules maintained and updated by the EFF.

This package provides the HTTPS Everywhere add-on for use with Tor
Browser.  It will not work with any other Mozilla-based browser
package.
