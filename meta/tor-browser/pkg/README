${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
=========================

To start Tor Browser:

  $ ${BROWSER_NAME}

This will create a ~/TorBrowser-Data directory if it does not exist.

Tor Browser uses its own instance of the tor server running on a
different port than the net/tor port is configured for by default.  It
starts and stops this tor daemon using the tor-launcher addon (package
tb-tor-launcher).  It should not interfere with any tor daemon you
have running via the standard mechanism (e.g. rcctl start tor).

The tor instance used by Tor Browser stores its configuration in
~/TorBrowser-Data/Browser/torrc; the tor daemon state lives in
~/TorBrowser-Data/Browser/tor_data.  When you use Tor Browser to
change your configuration (e.g. add bridges) the above torrc is
updated.  You can also add bridges by editing your torrc yourself.
Make sure Tor Browser is not running before doing so.

The Tor Browser ports do not yet include Pluggable Transports (PT).
This means that not all features are yet available, such as using
obfsproxy to get to Tor.  A future release will include ports for PT.
