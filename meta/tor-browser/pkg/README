| ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD

To start Tor Browser:

  $ tor-browser

This will create a ~/TorBrowser-Data directory if it does not exist.

Tor Browser uses its own instance of the tor server running on a
different port than the net/tor port is configured to use by default.
It starts and stops this tor daemon using the tor-launcher add-on
(www/tor-browser/tor-launcher).  It should not interfere with any tor
daemon you have running via the standard mechanism (e.g. rcctl start
tor).

The tor instance used by Tor Browser stores its configuration in
~/TorBrowser-Data/Browser/torrc; the tor daemon state lives in
~/TorBrowser-Data/Browser/tor_data.  When you use Tor Browser to
change your configuration (e.g. add bridges) the above torrc is
updated.  You can also add bridges by editing your torrc yourself.
Make sure Tor Browser is not running before doing so if you use this
method; if Tor Browser is running it might overwrite your torrc.

NOTE: The OpenBSD Tor Browser ports do not yet include Pluggable
Transports (PT).  This means that not all features are yet available,
such as using obfsproxy to get to Tor.  A future update will include
ports for PT components.  Pluggable Transports have a web page
worth reading:
  https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en
