# OpenBSD Ports for the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) #

These are the OpenBSD ports that correspond to the Tor browser bundle.
They are a work in progress.  Please beware that until we make release
announcements on [our web site](https://torbsd.github.io) you should
be careful using this stuff.  You must be runing OpenBSD -current and
have your ports and src synced up (like I said: running -current).

## Versions ##

These are the versions of the major components of TBB in this branch,
which is
[TBB 6.0.2](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-602-released).

    ff-esr            45.2.0
    torbutton         1.9.5.5
    tor-launcher      0.2.9.3
    noscript          2.9.0.11
    https-everywhere  5.1.9

## Repositories ##

Most of the ports in this repo pull their source tarballs from other
GH [torbsd repositories](https://github.com/torbsd).  This is because
the Tor project chooses not to make source tarballs easily available
for anything except tor itself (their gitian-based build process does
not require them).  Also, the OpenBSD ports system explicitly supports
pointing at GH projects.  I maintain the tags and branches in these
repositories and track changes in the
[tor project's git repositories](https://gitweb.torproject.org).
Where possible I prefer to have ports pull source from some
authoritative download area maintained by the project itself; in the
case of noscript I do this, for example.

## Beware: Experimental Until Otherwise Stated ##

This is still work in progress.  Until we make an official release
statement you should use this only if you want to help in testing.
